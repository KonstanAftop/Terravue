# Project Brief: Indonesian Carbon Market Platform

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** A specialized SaaS platform that serves as Indonesia's premier carbon market trading and verification ecosystem, similar to Stockbit/Bibit/Ajaib but exclusively focused on carbon credits.

**Primary Problem:** Local landowners and communities lack direct access to national carbon markets, while carbon verification processes are inefficient and lack transparency due to limited geospatial and satellite technology integration.

**Target Market:** Indonesian landowners, forest communities, carbon project developers, and institutional carbon credit buyers seeking transparent, efficient carbon market access.

**Key Value Proposition:** Connect local carbon producers directly to national markets while providing advanced geospatial verification capabilities that increase trust, transparency, and market efficiency.
