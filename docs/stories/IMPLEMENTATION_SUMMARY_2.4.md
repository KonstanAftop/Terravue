# Story 2.4 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented interactive mapping functionality for land boundary marking and visualization.

## Implementation Date
October 11, 2025

## Agent
Claude Sonnet 4.5

## What Was Built

### 1. Interactive Map Component
- Full-screen map interface using React-Leaflet
- Multiple tile layer support (Street, Satellite, Terrain)
- Zoom and pan controls
- Responsive Material-UI control panel

### 2. Drawing Tools
- Click-to-draw polygon boundary creation
- Real-time vertex addition
- Visual markers for each vertex
- Draw mode toggle (Start/Finish/Cancel)
- Polygon rendering with transparency

### 3. Coordinate & Area Calculation
- Real-time cursor position display
- Decimal degree coordinate format
- DMS (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds) format support
- Automatic area calculation using Shoelace formula
- Area display in hectares and acres
- Perimeter calculation

### 4. Boundary Validation
- Polygon closure validation
- Self-intersection detection
- Minimum area warnings
- Real-time validation feedback
- Error and warning messages

### 5. Data Persistence
- Browser localStorage for boundary data
- GeoJSON export functionality
- Boundary metadata (name, area, timestamp)
- Download as `.geojson` file

### 6. Map Utilities
- `calculatePolygonArea()` - Shoelace formula implementation
- `calculateDistance()` - Haversine formula
- `formatCoordinate()` - Multiple format support
- `isPolygonClosed()` - Validation helper
- `hasSelfIntersection()` - Geometry validation
- `validateBoundary()` - Complete validation
- `convertArea()` - Unit conversion

## Key Features

✅ **Full-screen Interactive Map**: Leaflet-based map with smooth navigation
✅ **Drawing Tools**: Intuitive polygon creation by clicking
✅ **Multi-layer Support**: Street, Satellite, and Terrain views
✅ **Real-time Coordinates**: Live cursor position tracking
✅ **Area Calculation**: Automatic calculation in multiple units
✅ **Boundary Validation**: Comprehensive error checking
✅ **Save & Export**: Local storage and GeoJSON export
✅ **Clean UI**: Material-UI integrated controls

## Acceptance Criteria Met

1. ✅ Full-screen map interface with zoom, pan, and layer controls
2. ✅ Drawing tools for marking land boundaries (polygon creation)
3. ✅ Coordinate display updates in real-time
4. ✅ Area calculation automatically updates
5. ✅ Save and load functionality (localStorage + GeoJSON export)
6. ✅ Satellite and terrain layer options
7. ⚠️  GPS coordinate import (deferred - would require additional file parsing libraries)
8. ✅ Boundary validation (closure, self-intersection)

## Deferred Features (Post-MVP)
- GPS file import (GPX, KML, CSV parsing)
- Advanced editing tools (vertex dragging, insertion)
- Overlap detection with existing boundaries
- Mobile touch gesture optimization
- Offline map tile caching

## How to Use

### Access Interactive Map
1. Log in as a **landowner** (john@example.com / password123)
2. Click **"Peta Interaktif"** in the sidebar
3. You'll see a full-screen map centered on Indonesia

### Draw a Boundary
1. Enter a name for your land parcel
2. Click the **"Draw"** button
3. Click on the map to add vertices
4. Add at least 3 points to form a polygon
5. Click **"Finish"** to complete the polygon

### View Statistics
- The control panel shows:
  - Number of vertices
  - Total area (hectares and acres)
  - Current cursor position
  - Validation results

### Change Map Layer
- Click **"Street"**, **"Satellite"**, or **"Terrain"** buttons
- Layers switch instantly

### Save & Export
- **Save**: Stores boundary to browser localStorage
- **Clear**: Removes current boundary
- **Export**: Downloads as GeoJSON file

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `react-leaflet`: React components for Leaflet
- `leaflet`: Core mapping library
- `@types/leaflet`: TypeScript definitions
- `leaflet-draw`: Drawing tools (installed but not fully integrated)

### Map Tile Sources
- **Street**: OpenStreetMap
- **Satellite**: ArcGIS World Imagery
- **Terrain**: OpenTopoMap

### Area Calculation
Uses the Shoelace formula with Haversine distance correction for accurate area calculation on Earth's curved surface.

### File Structure
```
apps/web/src/
├── pages/
│   └── InteractiveMap.tsx          # Main map component
├── utils/
│   └── mapUtils.ts                 # Calculation utilities
└── __tests__/
    └── utils/
        └── mapUtils.test.ts        # Utility tests
```

## Testing

Basic unit tests created for map utilities:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm test -- mapUtils.test.ts
```

Tests cover:
- Area calculation
- Distance calculation
- Coordinate formatting
- Polygon validation
- Unit conversion

## Known Limitations

1. **GPS Import**: Not implemented (requires additional libraries for GPX/KML parsing)
2. **Vertex Editing**: Cannot drag existing vertices (would need leaflet-draw full integration)
3. **Mobile Gestures**: Basic touch support, not fully optimized
4. **Offline Maps**: Requires network for tile loading

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with land registration flow
2. Add ability to edit saved boundaries
3. Implement GPS file import
4. Add more validation rules
5. Optimize for mobile devices
6. Add boundary comparison/overlap detection
