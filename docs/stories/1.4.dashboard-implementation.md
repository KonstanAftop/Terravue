## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.3 established the project foundation, authentication system, and navigation framework. The dashboard serves as the main landing page that integrates all these systems and provides the central hub for user activity.

### Dashboard Data Structure
[Source: architecture.md#dashboard-endpoints]
```typescript
interface DashboardData {
  userSummary: {
    totalLands: number;
    verifiedLands: number;
    totalCredits: number;
    totalTransactions: number;
  };
  marketSummary: {
    currentPrice: number;
    priceChange: number;
    volume: number;
  };
  recentActivity: Array<{
    type: string;
    description: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }>;
}
```

### Dashboard Component Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#dashboard-component]
- **Responsibility:** Main landing page displaying carbon market overview, user statistics, and quick actions
- **Key Interfaces:** `/api/v1/dashboard`, `/api/v1/market/summary`, Navigation to other sections
- **Dependencies:** AuthService, MarketDataService, UserService
- **Technology Stack:** React + TypeScript, MUI components, Zustand for state, Chart.js for visualizations

### API Endpoints
[Source: architecture.md#rest-api-specification]

**Dashboard Data Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/v1/dashboard
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Response: 200 OK + DashboardData
```

**Market Summary Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/v1/market/summary
Response: 200 OK + {
  currentPrice: number,
  priceChange24h: number,
  volume24h: number,
  totalCreditsAvailable: number
}
```

**Market Data Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/v1/market/data?period=7d&region=indonesia
Response: 200 OK + MarketData[]
```

### Dashboard Data Loading Flow
[Source: architecture.md#dashboard-data-loading-flow]
1. User accesses Dashboard → Frontend calls GET /dashboard with JWT
2. Parallel loading: User Summary + Credit Summary + Market Data
3. DashboardAPI aggregates all data → Returns complete dashboard data
4. Frontend updates charts and user stats → Display complete dashboard
5. Auto-refresh every 30 seconds with optimistic updates

### Market Data Simulation
[Source: architecture.md#mock-market-data-feed]
- **Implementation:** Local data generator with realistic price fluctuations
- **Price Generation:** Mathematical models for realistic Indonesian carbon pricing
- **Volume Simulation:** Trading volume changes and market trends
- **Regional Data:** Indonesia-specific carbon market characteristics

### Chart.js Integration
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Chart.js:** For carbon price visualization and progress charts
- **Chart Types:** Line charts (price trends), Bar charts (progress), Pie charts (land distribution)
- **Responsive Design:** Charts adapt to mobile screen sizes
- **Real-time Updates:** Charts update with new data every 30 seconds
