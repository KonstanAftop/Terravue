## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Epic 1 established authentication and navigation, Epic 2 created complete land management with verification. Story 3.1 builds on verified land parcels from Epic 2 to enable landowners to monetize their carbon assets through marketplace listings.

### Carbon Credit Data Model
[Source: architecture.md#carboncredit]
```typescript
interface CarbonCredit {
  id: string;
  landParcelId: string;
  quantity: number;
  pricePerCredit: number; // IDR
  status: 'available' | 'sold' | 'reserved';
  validUntil: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  description?: string;
  projectDetails?: {
    forestType: string;
    conservationMethods: string[];
    certifications: string[];
    additionalBenefits: string[];
  };
}

interface CreditListingDraft {
  id: string;
  landParcelId?: string;
  quantity?: number;
  pricePerCredit?: number;
  description?: string;
  validUntil?: Date;
  savedAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
}
```

### Carbon Credit API Endpoints
[Source: architecture.md#rest-api-specification]

**Credit Listing Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/v1/credits
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Content-Type: application/json
Body: {
  landParcelId: string,
  quantity: number,
  pricePerCredit: number,
  validUntil: string (ISO date),
  description?: string
}
Response: 201 Created + CarbonCredit
```

**Credit Update Endpoint:**
```
PUT /api/v1/credits/{id}
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Content-Type: application/json
Body: Partial<CarbonCredit>
Response: 200 OK + CarbonCredit
```

### Carbon Credit Trading Flow
[Source: architecture.md#carbon-credit-trading-flow]
1. Landowner selects verified land parcel → Frontend validates ownership
2. POST /credits with JWT → CreditService validates land ownership
3. CreditService creates credit with status 'available' → Store in CreditRepository
4. Frontend displays listing success → Navigate to listing management

### Carbon Credit Service Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#carbon-credit-service]
- **Responsibility:** Carbon credit listing, marketplace operations, and availability management
- **Key Interfaces:** Credit listing and search endpoints, Price filtering and sorting, Status management
- **Dependencies:** CreditRepository, LandRepository for validation
- **Technology Stack:** Express routes, business logic for credit calculations, market operations

### Carbon Credit Calculation
[Source: architecture.md#landparcel]
```typescript
interface CarbonCalculationFactors {
  'primary-forest': 15; // credits per hectare per year
  'secondary-forest': 10;
  'plantation-forest': 8;
  'agroforestry': 5;
  'degraded-land': 3;
}

function calculateCarbonCredits(
  landArea: number, 
  forestType: string, 
  timeframe: number = 1
): number {
  const factors: CarbonCalculationFactors = {
    'primary-forest': 15,
    'secondary-forest': 10,
    'plantation-forest': 8,
    'agroforestry': 5,
    'degraded-land': 3
  };
  
  const factor = factors[forestType] || 5;
  return Math.round(landArea * factor * timeframe);
}
```

      await this.creditRepository.updateStatus(credit.id, 'expired');
      await this.notificationService.sendExpirationNotice(credit.ownerId);
    }
  }
  
  // Run every hour to check for expired listings
  startExpirationScheduler(): void {
