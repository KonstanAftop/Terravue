# Story 1.2: User Authentication System

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** potential TerraVue user,
**I want** to register and login securely with role-based access,
**so that** I can access platform features appropriate to my user type.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Registration form accepts email, password, full name, and user type (Landowner/Buyer)
2. Email verification required before account activation
3. Login form authenticates users and creates secure sessions
4. Password reset functionality via email link
5. Role-based access control distinguishes between landowner and buyer permissions
6. User sessions persist across browser sessions and expire after 7 days of inactivity
7. Authentication state managed consistently across all application pages

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the project foundation with monorepo structure, mock data generators, and development environment. The authentication system builds on this foundation using the established in-memory data storage and Express/React architecture.

### User Data Model
[Source: architecture.md#data-models]
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // hashed with bcrypt
  fullName: string;
  userType: 'landowner' | 'buyer';
  createdAt: Date;
  lastLogin?: Date;
}
```

### Authentication Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#authentication-service]
- **Technology Stack:** Express middleware, JWT tokens, bcrypt, in-memory user storage
- **Key Interfaces:** 
  - `POST /auth/register` - User registration
  - `POST /auth/login` - User authentication  
  - JWT middleware for protected routes
- **Dependencies:** UserRepository, bcrypt for password hashing

### API Endpoints Specification
[Source: architecture.md#rest-api-specification]

**Registration Endpoint:**
```
POST /auth/register
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string", 
  "fullName": "string",
  "userType": "landowner" | "buyer"
}
Response: 201 Created + User object
```

**Login Endpoint:**
```
POST /auth/login
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
Response: 200 OK + { token: string, user: User }
```

### Authentication Flow
[Source: architecture.md#user-registration-and-authentication-flow]
1. User submits registration → Frontend validates → POST /auth/register
2. AuthService checks email availability → Hash password with bcrypt → Store in UserRepository
3. User submits login → AuthService validates credentials → Generate JWT token
4. Frontend stores token in localStorage → Include in Authorization header for protected routes
5. JWT middleware validates tokens on protected endpoints

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **JWT Tokens:** Version 9.0+ for stateless authentication
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt 5.1+ with salt rounds
- **Session Management:** 7-day token expiration with automatic refresh
- **CORS Configuration:** Restrict to localhost:3000 during development

### Frontend State Management
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Zustand 4.4+:** Lightweight state management for auth state
- **localStorage:** Token persistence across browser sessions
- **Material-UI 5.14+:** Form components with built-in validation
- **React 18.2+:** Component-based authentication UI

### Mock Email Integration
[Source: architecture.md#mock-email-service]
- **Implementation:** Console logging with email-like formatting
- **Email Templates:** Verification emails and password reset links
- **Development Testing:** All email content logged to console
- **No External Dependencies:** Completely local email simulation

### Role-Based Access Control
[Source: architecture.md#user-data-model]
- **User Types:** 'landowner' | 'buyer' enum values
- **Navigation Permissions:** Hide/show sections based on user role
- **Route Protection:** ProtectedRoute component with role checking
- **API Authorization:** JWT middleware validates user permissions

### Testing
[Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- **Test Location:** `apps/web/src/__tests__/auth/` for frontend, `apps/api/tests/routes/` for backend
- **Framework:** Vitest + Testing Library for components, Supertest for API
- **Coverage:** Registration flow, login flow, token validation, role-based access
- **Integration Tests:** Complete authentication workflows end-to-end
