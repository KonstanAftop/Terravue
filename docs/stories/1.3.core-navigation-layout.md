## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the project foundation and Story 1.2 implemented authentication with role-based access control. The navigation system builds on the authentication to provide role-aware navigation and serves as the foundation for all TerraVue features.

### Navigation Structure
[Source: prompt.md]
```
[TerraVue Logo]
- Dashboard
- Kelola Lahan
- Peta Dunia  
- Market Karbon
- Profil & Aktivitas
- Logout
```

### UI Design Requirements
[Source: user-interface-design-goals.md#branding]
- **Earth-tone color palette:** Greens, browns, blues for sustainability theme
- **Professional typography:** Suitable for financial data display
- **Consistent iconography:** Emphasizing sustainability and technology
- **Logo placement:** In sidebar navigation as specified
- **Trust-building elements:** Professional appearance for financial credibility

### Responsive Design Strategy
[Source: user-interface-design-goals.md#target-device-and-platforms]
- **Primary:** Responsive web application optimized for desktop and mobile
- **Desktop focus:** Trading and detailed land management features
- **Mobile optimization:** Field data collection and basic monitoring
- **Browser support:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **React 18.2+:** Component-based UI with TypeScript
- **Material-UI 5.14+:** Pre-built components for rapid development
- **Tailwind CSS 3.3+:** Utility-first CSS for consistent design
- **React Router:** Client-side routing for single-page application
- **Zustand 4.4+:** State management for navigation and auth state

- **User Types:** 'landowner' | 'buyer' from authentication system
- **Navigation Permissions:** Hide/show sections based on user role
- **Dynamic Updates:** Navigation changes when user role changes
- **Access Control:** Integration with authentication state from Story 1.2

### Navigation Sections and Permissions

**Kelola Lahan (Landowners Only):**
- Land portfolio management, registration, verification

**Peta Dunia (All Users):**
- Interactive world map with verified land areas

**Market Karbon (All Users):**
- Carbon credit marketplace (different views per role)

**Profil & Aktivitas (All Users):**

```typescript
// Route structure
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Dashboard, protected: true },
  { path: '/dashboard', component: Dashboard, protected: true },
  { path: '/land-management', component: LandManagement, protected: true, roles: ['landowner'] },
  { path: '/global-map', component: GlobalMap, protected: true },
