# Next Steps

## Architect Prompt

**Ready for Architecture Phase:** This PRD provides comprehensive requirements for Terravue MVP with dummy data only. Please review the technical assumptions, epic structure, and detailed user stories to create the technical architecture document. Focus on the monorepo structure, React/TypeScript frontend, Node.js/Express backend with in-memory data storage, mock data generators, and simulated integrations for all external services. The architecture should be completely self-contained, runnable with simple npm commands, and support the 4-epic development sequence without any databases, external dependencies, or containerization.

## UX Expert Prompt

**Ready for Design Phase:** The PRD defines Terravue's complete user experience requirements including navigation structure, core screens, and interaction paradigms. Please create the design system and wireframes based on the specified earth-tone branding, stock-trading interface patterns, and mobile-responsive requirements. Focus on the 6 main navigation sections (Dashboard, Kelola Lahan, Peta Dunia, Market Karbon, Profil & Aktivitas) with emphasis on clarity and trust-building for financial transactions.
