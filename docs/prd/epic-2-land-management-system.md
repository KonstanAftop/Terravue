# Epic 2: Land Management System

**Epic Goal:** Enable landowners to register, manage, and track their land parcels with basic verification capabilities and interactive mapping, creating the foundational data needed for carbon credit trading while providing immediate value to landowners.

## Story 2.1: Land Portfolio Management

As a landowner,
I want to view and manage all my registered land parcels in one place,
so that I can track my carbon assets efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Land list displays all user's parcels with key information (name, area, location, status)
2. Search functionality filters lands by name, location, or verification status
3. Sort functionality orders lands by date added, area size, or verification status
4. Pagination supports large numbers of land parcels (50+ per page)
5. Quick status indicators show verification progress for each parcel
6. Bulk actions allow selection and status updates for multiple parcels
7. Export functionality generates CSV report of land portfolio

## Story 2.2: Add New Land Registration

As a landowner,
I want to register new land parcels with basic information,
so that I can begin the carbon credit verification process.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Land registration form captures: name, coordinates, area size, land type, ownership documents
2. Interactive map picker allows users to select land location by clicking or coordinate entry
3. File upload supports ownership documents (PDF, images) with size limits
4. Form validation ensures all required fields completed before submission
5. Coordinate validation confirms location is within Indonesian territory
6. Area calculation automatically computed from coordinate boundaries when possible
7. Success confirmation displays with next steps for verification process
8. Draft save functionality allows users to complete registration later

## Story 2.3: Land Detail and Verification

As a landowner,
I want to view detailed information about my land parcels and complete verification,
so that I can qualify for carbon credit trading.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Land detail page displays comprehensive information: coordinates, area, ownership docs, history
2. Verification status clearly indicates current stage and required actions
3. Mock satellite imagery display shows simulated land cover (using local image files)
4. Verification form allows submission of additional documentation and information
5. Activity timeline tracks all changes and updates to land parcel
6. Verification progress indicator shows completion percentage
7. Estimated carbon potential calculation based on land area and type
8. Edit functionality allows updates to land information before verification completion

## Story 2.4: Basic Interactive Mapping

As a landowner,
I want to use interactive maps for land boundary marking and visualization,
so that I can accurately define my land parcels.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Full-screen map interface with zoom, pan, and layer controls
2. Drawing tools for marking land boundaries (polygon creation)
3. Coordinate display updates in real-time as boundaries are drawn
4. Area calculation automatically updates as boundaries are modified
5. Save and load functionality for boundary data
6. Satellite and terrain layer options for better land visualization
7. GPS coordinate import functionality for precise boundary definition
8. Boundary validation ensures polygons are closed and non-overlapping
