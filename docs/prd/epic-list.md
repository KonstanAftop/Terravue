# Epic List

Based on the TerraVue MVP requirements, I've structured the development into 4 sequential epics that each deliver significant value:

**Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication**  
Establish core project infrastructure, user authentication, and basic dashboard functionality to create a deployable foundation with initial user value.

**Epic 2: Land Management System**  
Enable landowners to register, manage, and view their land parcels with basic verification capabilities and interactive mapping.

**Epic 3: Carbon Market Trading**  
Implement the core trading functionality with carbon credit listings, basic market interface, and transaction processing.

**Epic 4: Global Mapping & Analytics**  
Add the interactive world map, market analytics, and user activity tracking to complete the MVP feature set.

## Rationale for Epic Structure:

**Why 4 Epics:**
- Each epic delivers a complete, testable increment of functionality
- Epic 1 establishes foundation while delivering immediate user value (dashboard)
- Epic 2 enables core landowner functionality (land management)
- Epic 3 delivers the key business value (carbon trading)
- Epic 4 completes the MVP with transparency and analytics features

**Sequential Dependencies:**
- Epic 1 provides authentication and UI foundation needed by all subsequent epics
- Epic 2 creates land data required for trading in Epic 3
- Epic 3 generates transaction data needed for analytics in Epic 4
- Each epic can be deployed independently and provides value

**MVP Focus:**
- Prioritizes core functionality over advanced features
- Balances landowner needs (land management) with buyer needs (trading)
- Includes essential transparency features (global map) for market trust
- Defers complex features like advanced ESG reporting to post-MVP
