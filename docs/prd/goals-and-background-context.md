## Background Context

TerraVue addresses Indonesia's fragmented carbon market by providing a comprehensive digital platform that combines land management, geospatial verification, and carbon trading in one integrated solution. The platform serves both landowners seeking to monetize their forest carbon and institutional buyers requiring verified, transparent carbon credits.

Unlike general financial platforms, TerraVue focuses exclusively on carbon markets with specialized features including interactive global mapping, satellite-based verification, real-time carbon pricing, and comprehensive ESG reporting capabilities designed specifically for the Indonesian carbon market ecosystem.
